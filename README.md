# ❓ Quora Question Pair Similarity

## 📌 Description
An NLP project to detect **duplicate question pairs** on Quora.  
Implemented classical methods (TF-IDF + cosine similarity)  
and a deep learning model (Siamese LSTM) to capture semantic similarity.  
Achieved **89% accuracy** and **F1-score of 0.85**.
